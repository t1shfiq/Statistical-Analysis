Analyzing a few key metrics for COVID-19 for specific countries

I made a simple python program leveraging the popular data science modules- pandas and matplotlib, to create a bar chart to depict the number of active COVID-19 cases in my native country, Bangladesh. 

Pandas is quite useful for converting the data collected from the csv file into data frames. The other module, matplotlib is used to make the bar chart.
The number of active cases is calculated by subtracting the deaths and recoveries from the confirmed cases.

The dataset source: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases. 

The graph is being currently used for a report I am writing for a Non-Profit Organization based in Bangladesh regarding the timeline of the flattening of the curve in the country and the reasons behind it. (Please refer to Graph.JPG)
